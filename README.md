# AMATH-482
This repository is a collection of assignments from the applied mathematics 482 course *Computational Methods for Data Analysis* taken at the University of Washington-Seattle in winter 2020. The course covered topics on data collection, data processing, and machine learning application. This repository will be a useful reasource for those currently taking AMATH 482 or anyone wanting to learn basic data analysis skills. This repository is organized into the five assignments from this course, and I will summerize the topics covered in each assignment.

## HW1: An Ultrasound Problem
- Spectrum Averaging
- Gaussian Filtering

## HW2: Gabor Transforms
- Gabor Filtering

## HW3: Principle Component Analysis
- Data Collection of Videos
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Principle Component Analysis

## HW4: Music Classification
- Data Collection of Music
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Linear Discriminant Analysis

## HW5: Neural Networks for Classifying Fashion MNIST
- Machine Learning
